This project is a fork of the [SpreadsheetLight library](https://spreadsheetlight.com/).

The purpose of this fork is to create a version of the library that runs on .NET 6.0+ and is also capable of running in cross-platform environments. The library uses System.Drawing.Common, which required some platform checks to ensure those code sections only run on Windows machines.

I am not intending to extend this library, however if a new version of the original library is released, I will update this library accordingly.
